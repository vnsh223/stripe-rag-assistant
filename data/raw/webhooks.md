# Receive Stripe events in your webhook endpoint

Listen for events from Stripe on your webhook endpoint so your integration can automatically trigger reactions.

You can create an HTTPS webhook endpoint to receive events. After you register a webhook endpoint, Stripe pushes real-time data to it when [events](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations.md#events-overview) happen in your Stripe account. Stripe uses HTTPS to send webhook events to your app as a JSON payload that includes event information.

Receiving webhook events helps you respond to asynchronous events, such as when a customer’s bank confirms a payment, a customer disputes a charge, or a recurring payment succeeds.

You can also consume Stripe events in your AWS or Azure infrastructure by sending events directly to [Amazon EventBridge](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations/eventbridge.md) or [Azure Event Grid](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations/eventgrid.md).

Complete the steps below to start receiving webhook events in your app. You can register and create one endpoint to handle several different event types at the same time or set up individual endpoints for specific events.

## Set up your endpoint

Use the [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/event-destinations.md) or the [Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) tab in Workbench to register your webhook endpoint’s accessible URL so Stripe knows where to deliver events. You can register up to 16 webhook endpoints with Stripe. Registered webhook endpoints must be publicly accessible HTTPS URLs.

- If you have a localhost server but don’t have a publically accessible HTTPS URL, you can use a tunnelling tool such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to generate a temporary publically accessible HTTPS URL to use for testing purposes.
- Alternatively, you can [test locally using Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#local-listener) before registering a publicly accessible HTTPS URL.

### Webhook URL format 

The URL format to register a webhook endpoint is:

```
https://<your-website>/<your-webhook-endpoint>
```

For example, if your domain is `https://mycompanysite.com` and the route to your webhook endpoint is `@app.route('/stripe_webhooks', methods=['POST'])`, specify `https://mycompanysite.com/stripe_webhooks` as the endpoint URL.

### Create an event destination for your webhook endpoint 

#### Dashboard

To create a new webhook endpoint in the Dashboard:

1. Open the [Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) tab in Workbench.
2. Click **Create an event destination**.
3. Select **Your account** to listen to events from your own account.
4. Select the API version for the [events object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events.md) you want to consume.
5. Select the [event types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md) that you want to send to a webhook endpoint.
6. Select **Continue**, then select **Webhook endpoint** as the destination type.
7. Click **Continue**, then provide the **Endpoint URL** and an optional description for the webhook.
8. On the webhook settings page, a signing secret beginning with `whsec_` appears. Click **Reveal secret** and copy the value to use when you [create a handler](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#webhook-endpoint-def).

> [Workbench](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench.md) replaces the existing [Developers Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/development/dashboard.md). You can still [create a new webhook endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/development/dashboard/webhooks.md) in the Developers Dashboard, although we recommend using Workbench.

#### API

Use the [/v2/core/event_destinations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/event-destinations.md) endpoint to register a new endpoint.

#### Snapshot events

To listen to [snapshot events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md) from your own account, set the [event_payload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/core/event-destinations/create.md#v2_create_event_destinations-event_payload) value to `snapshot` and the [enabled_events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/core/event-destinations/create.md#v2_create_event_destinations-enabled_events) value to the event types that you want to send to the webhook endpoint:

```curl
curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v2/core/event_destinations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>" \
  -H "Stripe-Version: 2026-08-26.preview" \
  --json '{
    "name": "My event destination",
    "type": "webhook_endpoint",
    "events_from": [
        "@self"
    ],
    "event_payload": "snapshot",
    "enabled_events": [
        "payment_intent.succeeded",
        "payment_intent.payment_failed"
    ],
    "webhook_endpoint": {
        "url": "https://mycompanysite.com/webhook"
    },
    "include": [
        "webhook_endpoint.signing_secret"
    ]
  }'
```

The output contains a `webhook_endpoint.signing_secret` value that starts with `whsec_`. Copy this value to use when you [create a handler](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#webhook-endpoint-def).

#### Thin events

If you are using [thin events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/core/events/event-types.md), you will need to register a separate webhook endpoint. Read more about [the differences between thin and snapshot events](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations.md#events-overview).

To listen to [thin events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/core/events/event-types.md) from your own account, set the [event_payload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/core/event-destinations/create.md#v2_create_event_destinations-event_payload) value to `thin` and the [enabled_events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/core/event-destinations/create.md#v2_create_event_destinations-enabled_events) value to the event types that you want to send to the webhook endpoint:

```curl
curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v2/core/event_destinations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>" \
  -H "Stripe-Version: 2026-08-26.preview" \
  --json '{
    "name": "My event destination",
    "type": "webhook_endpoint",
    "events_from": [
        "@self"
    ],
    "event_payload": "thin",
    "enabled_events": [
        "v1.billing.meter.error_report_triggered"
    ],
    "webhook_endpoint": {
        "url": "https://mycompanysite.com/webhook"
    },
    "include": [
        "webhook_endpoint.signing_secret"
    ]
  }'
```

The output contains a `webhook_endpoint.signing_secret` value that starts with `whsec_`. Copy this value to use when you [create a handler](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#webhook-endpoint-def).

### Test locally without a registered URL 

If you don’t have a registered publicly accessible HTTPS URL, you can test webhooks locally by using the Stripe CLI to [forward events to your local endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/cli/use-cli#forward-events-to-your-local-webhook-endpoint):

1. If you haven’t already, [install the Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/cli/install) on your machine.

2. Log in to your Stripe account and set up the CLI by running `stripe login` on the command line.

3. Allow your local host to receive a simulated event by running [stripe listen](https://docs.stripe.com/cli/listen), depending on the scope and type of event:

   #### Forward snapshot events

   Use the following command to forward [snapshot events](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations.md#events-overview) from your account to your local listener.

   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4242/webhook
   ```

   #### Forward thin events

   Use the following command to forward [thin events](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations.md#events-overview) from your account to your local listener.

   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-thin-to localhost:4242/webhook --thin-events "*"
   ```

   This command assumes you have a localhost website on port 4242 with a `POST /webhook` endpoint, which you can configure when you [create a handler](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#webhook-endpoint-def).

4. The `stripe listen` command outputs the `{{WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET}}`. Copy this value to use when you [create a handler](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#webhook-endpoint-def).

   ```output
   Ready! Your webhook signing secret is '{{WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET}}' (^C to quit)
   ```

> To use the `--forward-to` argument with `stripe listen`, you must run the command with [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/cli.md) in a terminal. This command can’t be run in the [Workbench Shell](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench/shell.md) because it doesn’t support the `--forward-to` argument.

## Create a handler

Set up an HTTP or HTTPS endpoint function that can accept webhook requests with a POST method. If you’re still developing your endpoint function on your local machine, it can use HTTP. After it’s publicly accessible, your webhook endpoint function must use HTTPS.

Use the Stripe API reference to identify the [thin event objects](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/core/events/event-types.md) or [snapshot event objects](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md) your webhook handler needs to process.

Set up your endpoint function so that it:

- Handles POST requests with a JSON payload that includes event information.
- Verifies the webhook request is generated by Stripe using the JSON payload, the `Stripe-Signature` header, and the `whsec_` webhook signing secret from the previous step. If verification fails, you get an error.
- Quickly returns a successful status code (`2xx`) before any complex logic that might cause a timeout. For example, you must return a `200` response before updating a customer’s invoice as paid in your accounting system.

> #### Don't manipulate the raw body request
> 
> Stripe requires the raw body of the request to perform signature verification. If you’re using a framework, make sure it doesn’t manipulate the raw body. Any manipulation to the raw body of the request causes the verification to fail.
> 
> Learn how to [troubleshoot signature verification errors](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/signature.md).

#### Example endpoint 

This code snippet is a webhook function configured to check for received events from a Stripe account, handle the events, and return a `200` responses. Reference the [snapshot](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations.md#events-overview) event handler when you use API v1 resources, and reference the [thin](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations.md#events-overview) event handler when you use API v2 resources.

#### Snapshot event handler

When you create a snapshot event handler, use the API object definition at the time of the event for your logic by accessing the event’s `data.object` fields. You can also retrieve the API resource from the Stripe API to access the latest and up-to-date object definition.

#### Ruby

```ruby
require 'json'
require 'stripe'

client = Stripe::StripeClient.new(ENV.fetch('STRIPE_API_KEY'))

# Replace this endpoint secret with your unique endpoint secret key
# If you're testing with the CLI, run 'stripe listen' to find the secret key
# If you defined your endpoint using the API or the Dashboard, check your webhook settings for your endpoint secret: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
endpoint_secret = 'whsec_...';

# Using Sinatra
post '/webhook' do
  payload = request.body.read
  event = nil

  begin
    event = Stripe::Event.construct_from(
      JSON.parse(payload, symbolize_names: true)
    )
  rescue JSON::ParserError => e
    # Invalid payload
    status 400
    return
  end

  # Check that you have configured webhook signing
  if endpoint_secret
    # Retrieve the event by verifying the signature using the raw body and the endpoint secret
    signature = request.env['HTTP_STRIPE_SIGNATURE'];
    begin
      event = Stripe::Webhook.construct_event(
        payload, signature, endpoint_secret
      )
    rescue Stripe::SignatureVerificationError => e
      puts "⚠️  Webhook signature verification failed. #{e.message}"
      status 400
    end
  end

  # Handle the event
  case event.type
  when 'payment_intent.succeeded'
    payment_intent = event.data.object # contains a Stripe::PaymentIntent
    # Then define and call a method to handle the successful payment intent.
    # handle_payment_intent_succeeded(payment_intent)
  when 'payment_method.attached'
    payment_method = event.data.object # contains a Stripe::PaymentMethod
    # Then define and call a method to handle the successful attachment of a PaymentMethod.
    # handle_payment_method_attached(payment_method)
  # ... handle other event types
  else
    puts "Unhandled event type: #{event.type}"
  end

  status 200
end
```

#### Thin event handler (Clover+)

When you create a thin event handler, use the `fetchRelatedObject()` method to retrieve the latest version of the object associated with the event. Events might contain [additional data](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations.md#fetch-data) that you can only retrieve through the `.fetchEvent()` instance method on `EventNotification`. The exact shape of that data depends on the `type` of the Event.

Event types must be available at the time of release to generate classes in that SDK version. To handle Events the SDK doesn’t have classes for, use the `UnknownEventNotification` class.

#### Python

```python
import os
from stripe import StripeClient
from stripe.events import UnknownEventNotification

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)
api_key = os.environ.get("STRIPE_API_KEY", "")
webhook_secret = os.environ.get("WEBHOOK_SECRET", "")

client = StripeClient(api_key)

@app.route("/webhook", methods=["POST"])
def webhook():
    webhook_body = request.data
    sig_header = request.headers.get("Stripe-Signature")

    try:
        event_notif = client.parse_event_notification(
            webhook_body, sig_header, webhook_secret
        )

        # type checkers will narrow the type based on the `type` property
        if event_notif.type == "v1.billing.meter.error_report_triggered":
            # in this block, event_notification is typed as
            # a V1BillingMeterErrorReportTriggeredEventNotification

            # there's basic info about the related object in the notification
            print(f"Meter w/ id {event_notif.related_object.id} had a problem")

            # or you can fetch the full object form the API for more details
            meter = event_notif.fetch_related_object()
            print(
                f"Meter {meter.display_name} ({meter.id}) had a problem"
            )

            # And you can always fetch the full event:
            event = event_notif.fetch_event()
            print(f"More info: {event.data.developer_message_summary}")

        elif event_notif.type == "v1.billing.meter.no_meter_found":
            # in this block, event_notification is typed as
            # a V1BillingMeterNoMeterFoundEventNotification

            # that class doesn't define `fetch_related_object` because the event
            # has no related object.
            # so this line would correctly give a type error:
            # meter = event_notif.fetch_related_object()

            # but fetching the event always works:
            event = event_notif.fetch_event()
            print(
                f"Err! No meter found: {event.data.developer_message_summary}"
            )

        # Events that were introduced after this SDK version release are
        # represented as `UnknownEventNotification`s.
        # They're valid, the SDK just doesn't have corresponding classes for them.
        # You must match on the "type" property instead.
        elif isinstance(event_notif, UnknownEventNotification):
            # these lines are optional, but will give you more accurate typing in this block
            from typing import cast

            event_notif = cast(UnknownEventNotification, event_notif)

            # continue matching on the type property
            # from this point on, the `related_object` property _may_ be None
            # (depending on the event type)
            if event_notif.type == "some.new.event":
                # if this event type has a related object, you can fetch it
                obj = event_notif.fetch_related_object()
                # otherwise, `obj` will just be `None`
                print(f"Related object: {obj}")

                # you can still fetch the full event, but it will be untyped
                event = event_notif.fetch_event()
                print(f"New event: {event.data}")  # type: ignore

        return jsonify(success=True), 200
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify(error=str(e)), 400
```

## Test your handler

Before you go live with your webhook endpoint function, we recommend testing your application integration by triggering events in a sandbox or sending test events with the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/cli.md).

### Trigger test events 

To send test events, trigger an event type that your event destination is subscribed to by manually creating an object in the Stripe Dashboard. Learn how to trigger events with [Stripe for VS Code](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-vscode.md).

#### Trigger a snapshot event

You can use the following command in either [Stripe Shell](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench/shell.md) or [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/cli.md). This example triggers a `payment_intent.succeeded` event:

```bash
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
Running fixture for: payment_intent
Trigger succeeded! Check dashboard for event details.
```

#### Trigger a thin event

You can use the following command in the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/cli.md). This example triggers a `v1.billing.meter.error_report_triggered` event:

```bash
stripe trigger v1.billing.meter.error_report_triggered
Setting up fixture for: list_billing_meters
Running fixture for: list_billing_meters
Setting up fixture for: billing_meter
Running fixture for: billing_meter
Setting up fixture for: list_billing_meters_after_creation
Running fixture for: list_billing_meters_after_creation
Setting up fixture for: billing_meter_event_session
Running fixture for: billing_meter_event_session
Setting up fixture for: create_billing_meter_event_stream
Running fixture for: create_billing_meter_event_stream
Trigger succeeded! Check dashboard for event details.
```

## Optional: Create an event destination for Connect

When you [create an event destination](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#create-webhook-endpoint) as a Connect platform, you choose which scope it listens to:

#### Dashboard

- **Your account**: Events from resources in your account.
- **Connected accounts**: Events from resources that belong to your connected accounts.

#### API

- [events_from=[“@self”]](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/core/event-destinations/create.md#v2_create_event_destinations-events_from): Events from resources in your account.
- [events_from=[“@accounts”]](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/core/event-destinations/create.md#v2_create_event_destinations-events_from): Events from resources that belong to your connected accounts.

Register an event destination for **Connected accounts** to receive events for resources that belong to your connected accounts. Examples include [direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges.md), Customers and payment methods of connected accounts, payout failures, and legacy snapshot connected-account lifecycle updates, such as onboarding, verification, external-account changes, and account disconnections. For Accounts v2, this scope only receives snapshot events for Account objects representing your connected accounts.

Depending on your Connect integration, you may also need to register an event destination for **Your account**. Reasons include:

- Processing events for resources in your platform account, including platform Customers, platform-owned charges, [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges.md), and [separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers.md).
- Processing thin events related to Accounts v2 objects representing connected accounts.

See [Connect webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/webhooks.md?accounts-namespace=v2) for more details.

### Test Connect locally without a registered URL 

#### Snapshot events

Use the following command to forward [snapshot events](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations.md#events-overview) from connected accounts to your local listener.

```bash
stripe listen --forward-connect-to localhost:4242/webhook
```

#### Thin events

Use the following command to forward [thin events](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations.md#events-overview) from connected accounts to your local listener.

```bash
stripe listen --forward-thin-connect-to localhost:4242/webhook --thin-events "*"
```

## Optional: Create an event destination for Organizations

When you [create an event destination](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#create-webhook-endpoint) as an Organization, you choose which scope it listens to:

#### Dashboard

- **Accounts in your organization**: Events from resources in your organization’s accounts.
- **Connected accounts**: Events from resources inside your organization’s connected accounts.

#### API

- [events_from=[“@organization_members”]](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/core/event-destinations/create.md#v2_create_event_destinations-events_from): Events from resources in your organization’s accounts.
- [events_from=[“@organization_members/@accounts”]](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/core/event-destinations/create.md#v2_create_event_destinations-events_from): Events from resources inside your organization’s connected accounts.

### Unsupported event type behaviors for organization event destinations

Stripe sends most event types asynchronously, but waits for a response for some event types. In these cases, Stripe behaves differently based on whether the event destination responds.

If your event destination receives [Organization](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/orgs.md) events, those requiring a response have the following limitations:

- You can’t subscribe to `issuing_authorization.request` for organization destinations. Instead, set up a [webhook endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#example-endpoint) in a Stripe account within the organization to subscribe to this event type. Use `issuing_authorization.request` to authorize purchase requests in real-time.
- Organization destinations receiving `checkout_sessions.completed` can’t [handle redirect behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment.md#redirect-hosted-checkout) when you embed [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout.md) directly in your website or redirect customers to a Stripe-hosted payment page. To influence Checkout redirect behavior, process this event type with a [webhook endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#example-endpoint) configured in a Stripe account within the organization.
- Organization destinations responding unsuccessfully to an `invoice.created` event can’t influence [automatic invoice finalization when using automatic collection](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks.md#understand). You must process this event type with a [webhook endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#example-endpoint) configured in a Stripe account within the organization to trigger automatic invoice finalization.

#### Using `context` 

#### Snapshot events

This code snippet is a webhook function configured to check for received events, detect the originating account if applicable, handle the event, and return a `200` response.

#### Ruby

```ruby
require 'json'

client = Stripe::StripeClient.new('sk_...')

# Using Sinatra
post '/webhook' do
  payload = request.body.read
  event = nil

  begin
    event = Stripe::Event.construct_from(
      JSON.parse(payload, symbolize_names: true)
    )
  rescue JSON::ParserError => e
    # Invalid payload
    status 400
    return
  end

  # Extract the context
  context = event.context

  # Define your API key variables (ideally loaded securely)
  ACCOUNT_123_API_KEY = "sk_test_123"
  ACCOUNT_456_API_KEY = "sk_test_456"

  account_api_keys = {
    "account_123" => ACCOUNT_123_API_KEY,
    "account_456" => ACCOUNT_456_API_KEY
  }

  api_key = account_api_keys[context]

  if api_key.nil?
    puts "No API key found for context: #{context}"
    status 400
    return
  end

  # Handle the event
  case event.type
  when 'customer.created'
    customer = event.data.object

    begin

      latest_customer = client.v1.customers.retrieve(customer.id, {api_key: api_key})
      handle_customer_created(latest_customer, context)
    rescue => e
      puts "Error retrieving customer: #{e.message}"
      status 500
      return
    end

  when 'payment_method.attached'
    payment_method = event.data.object

    begin
      latest_payment_method = client.v1.payment_methods.retrieve(payment_method.id, {api_key: api_key})
      handle_payment_method_attached(latest_payment_method, context)
    rescue => e
      puts "Error retrieving payment method: #{e.message}"
      status 500
      return
    end

  else
    puts "Unhandled event type: #{event.type}"
  end

  status 200
end
```

#### Thin event handler (Clover+)

Use the `EventNotification`’s `context` property to identify the account for events within your [organization](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/orgs.md). You must set the [Stripe-Context header](https://docs.stripe.com/context.md) manually for all API calls except `.fetchRelatedObject()` and `.fetchEvent()`, which do this for you automatically.

#### Python

```python
org_api_key = os.environ.get("STRIPE_API_KEY")
webhook_secret = os.environ.get("WEBHOOK_SECRET")
client = StripeClient(org_api_key)

# inside your webhook handler
event_notification = client.parse_event_notification(payload, sig_header, webhook_secret)

# uses `context` automatically
event_notification.fetch_event()

# pass context manually for other API requests
client.v1.invoices.list(stripe_context=event_notification.context)
```

## Debug webhook integrations 

Multiple types of issues can occur when delivering events to your webhook endpoint:

- Stripe might not be able to deliver an event to your webhook endpoint.
- Your webhook endpoint might have an SSL issue.
- Your network connectivity is intermittent.
- Your webhook endpoint isn’t receiving events that you expect to receive.

### View event deliveries 

To view event deliveries, open [Workbench](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench.md), select the webhook endpoint under **Webhooks**, then select the **Event deliveries** tab. The **Event deliveries** tab provides a list of events and whether they’re `Delivered`, `Pending`, or `Failed`. Click an event to view metadata, including the HTTP status code of the delivery attempt and the time of pending future deliveries.

You can also use the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/cli.md) to [listen for events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#test-webhook) directly in your terminal.

### Fix HTTP status codes

When an event displays a status code of `200`, it indicates successful delivery to the webhook endpoint. You might also receive a status code other than `200`. View the table below for a list of common HTTP status codes and recommended solutions.

| Pending webhook status | Description | Fix |

## Event delivery behaviors 

This section helps you understand different behaviors to expect regarding how Stripe sends events to your webhook endpoint.

### Automatic retries

Stripe attempts to deliver events to your destination for up to three days with an exponential back off in live mode. View when the next retry will occur, if applicable, in your event destination’s **Event deliveries** tab. We retry event deliveries created in a sandbox three times over the course of a few hours. If your destination has been disabled or deleted when we attempt a retry, we prevent future retries of that event. However, if you disable and then re-enable the event destination before we’re able to retry, you still see future retry attempts.

### Manual retries

There are two ways to manually retry events:

- In the Stripe Dashboard, click **Resend** when looking at a specific event. This works for up to 15 days after the event creation.
- With the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/cli/events/resend), run the `stripe events resend <event_id> --webhook-endpoint=<endpoint_id>` command. This works for up to 30 days after the event creation.

Manually resending an event that had previous delivery failures to a webhook endpoint doesn’t dismiss Stripe’s [automatic retry behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#automatic-retries), even if it results in a `2xx` status code. Learn how to [process undelivered webhook events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/process-undelivered-events.md) to stop future retries.

### Event ordering

Stripe doesn’t guarantee the delivery of events in the order that they’re generated. For example, creating a subscription might generate the following events:

- `customer.subscription.created`
- `invoice.created`
- `invoice.paid`
- `charge.created` (if there’s a charge)

Make sure that your event destination isn’t dependent on receiving events in a specific order. Snapshot events record `created` in seconds, so distinct events can share a timestamp. Don’t use `created` to determine event order or whether you’ve already processed an event. Track [event IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/object.md#event_object-id) to identify duplicate deliveries instead. You can also use the API to retrieve any missing objects. For example, you can retrieve the invoice, charge, and subscription objects with the information from `invoice.paid` if you receive this event first.

### API versioning

The API version in your account settings when the event occurs dictates the API version, and therefore the structure of an [Event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events.md) sent to your destination. For example, if your account is set to an older API version, such as 2015-02-16, and you change the API version for a specific request with [versioning](https://docs.stripe.com/api.md#versioning), the [Event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events.md) object generated and sent to your destination is still based on the 2015-02-16 API version. You can’t change [Event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events.md) objects after creation. For example, if you update a charge, the original charge event remains unchanged. As a result, subsequent updates to your account’s API version don’t retroactively alter existing [Event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events.md) objects. Retrieving an older [Event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events.md) by calling `/v1/events` using a newer API version also has no impact on the structure of the received event. You can set test event destinations to either your default API version or the latest API version. The [Event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events.md) sent to the destination is structured for the event destination’s specified version.

## Best practices for using webhooks 

Review these best practices to make sure your webhook endpoints remain secure and function well with your integration.

### Handle duplicate events

Webhook endpoints might occasionally receive the same event more than once. You can guard against duplicated event receipts by logging the [event IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/object.md#event_object-id) you’ve processed, and then not processing already-logged events.

In some cases, two separate Event objects are generated and sent. To identify these duplicates, use the ID of the object in `data.object` along with the `event.type`.

### Only listen to event types your integration requires

Configure your webhook endpoints to receive only the types of events required by your integration. Listening for extra events (or all events) puts undue strain on your server and we don’t recommend it.

You can [change the events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/webhook_endpoints/update.md#update_webhook_endpoint-enabled_events) that a webhook endpoint receives in the Dashboard or with the API.

### Handle events asynchronously

Configure your handler to process incoming events with an asynchronous queue. You might encounter scalability issues if you choose to process events synchronously. Any large spike in webhook deliveries (for example, during the beginning of the month when all subscriptions renew) might overwhelm your endpoint hosts.

Asynchronous queues allow you to process the concurrent events at a rate your system can support.

### Exempt webhook route from CSRF protection 

If you’re using Rails, Django, or another web framework, your site might automatically check that every POST request contains a *CSRF token*. This is an important security feature that helps protect you and your users from [cross-site request forgery](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_\(CSRF\)) attempts. However, this security measure might also prevent your site from processing legitimate events. If so, you might need to exempt the webhooks route from CSRF protection.

#### Rails

```ruby
class StripeController < ApplicationController
  # If your controller accepts requests other than Stripe webhooks,
  # you'll probably want to use `protect_from_forgery` to add CSRF
  # protection for your application. But don't forget to exempt
  # your webhook route!
  protect_from_forgery except: :webhook

  def webhook
    # Process webhook data in `params`
  end
end
```

### Receive events with an HTTPS server

If you use an HTTPS URL for your webhook endpoint (required in live mode), Stripe validates that the connection to your server is secure before sending your webhook data. For this to work, your server must be correctly configured to support HTTPS with a valid server certificate. Stripe webhooks support only *TLS* (TLS refers to the process of securely transmitting data between the client—the app or browser that your customer is using—and your server. This was originally performed using the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol) versions v1.2 and v1.3.

### Roll endpoint signing secrets periodically 

The secret used for verifying that events come from Stripe is modifiable in the [Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) tab in Workbench. To keep them safe, we recommend that you roll (change) secrets periodically, or when you suspect a compromised secret.

To roll a secret:

1. Click each endpoint in the Workbench [Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) tab that you want to roll the secret for.
2. Navigate to the overflow menu (⋯) and click **Roll secret**. You can choose to immediately expire the current secret or delay its expiration for up to 24 hours to allow yourself time to update the verification code on your server. During this time, multiple secrets are active for the endpoint. Stripe generates one signature per secret until expiration.

### Verify events are sent from Stripe 

Without verification, an attacker could send fake webhook events to your endpoint to trigger actions like fulfilling orders, granting account access, or modifying records. Always verify that webhook events originate from Stripe before acting on them.

Use both of these protections:

- **IP allowlisting**: Stripe sends webhook events from a set list of [IP addresses](https://docs.stripe.com/ips.md). Configure your server or firewall to only accept webhook requests from these addresses.
- **Signature verification**: Stripe signs every webhook event by including a signature in the `Stripe-Signature` header. Verify this signature using our [official libraries](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#verify-official-libraries) or [manually](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#verify-manually) to confirm the event wasn’t sent or modified by a third party.

The following section describes how to verify webhook signatures:

1. Retrieve your endpoint’s secret.
2. Verify the signature.

#### Retrieving your endpoint’s secret 

Use Workbench and go to the [Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) tab to view all your endpoints. Select an endpoint that you want to obtain the secret for, then click **Click to reveal**.

Stripe generates a unique secret key for each endpoint. If you use the same endpoint for both [test and live API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#test-live-modes), the secret is different for each one. Additionally, if you use multiple endpoints, you must obtain a secret for each one you want to verify signatures on. After this setup, Stripe starts to sign each webhook it sends to the endpoint.

#### Verify the signature 

#### Verify with official libraries (recommended)

### Verify webhook signatures with official libraries

We recommend using our official libraries to verify signatures. You perform the verification by providing the event payload, the `Stripe-Signature` header, and the endpoint’s secret. If verification fails, you get an error.

If you get a signature verification error, read our guide about [troubleshooting it](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/signature.md).

> Stripe requires the raw body of the request to perform signature verification. If you’re using a framework, make sure it doesn’t manipulate the raw body. Any manipulation to the raw body of the request causes the verification to fail.

#### Ruby

```ruby

# Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
# Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
client = Stripe::StripeClient.new('<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>')

require 'stripe'
require 'sinatra'

# If you are testing your webhook locally with the Stripe CLI you
# can find the endpoint's secret by running `stripe listen`
# Otherwise, find your endpoint's secret in your webhook settings in
# the Developer Dashboard
endpoint_secret = 'whsec_...'

# Using the Sinatra framework
set :port, 4242

post '/my/webhook/url' do
  payload = request.body.read
  sig_header = request.env['HTTP_STRIPE_SIGNATURE']
  event = nil

  begin
    event = Stripe::Webhook.construct_event(
      payload, sig_header, endpoint_secret
    )
  rescue JSON::ParserError => e
    # Invalid payload
    puts "Error parsing payload: #{e.message}"
    status 400
    return
  rescue Stripe::SignatureVerificationError => e
    # Invalid signature
    puts "Error verifying webhook signature: #{e.message}"
    status 400
    return
  end

  # Handle the event
  case event.type
  when 'payment_intent.succeeded'
    payment_intent = event.data.object # contains a Stripe::PaymentIntent
    puts 'PaymentIntent was successful!'
  when 'payment_method.attached'
    payment_method = event.data.object # contains a Stripe::PaymentMethod
    puts 'PaymentMethod was attached to a Customer!'
  # ... handle other event types
  else
    puts "Unhandled event type: #{event.type}"
  end

  status 200
end
```

#### Verify manually

### Verify webhook signatures manually 

Although we recommend that you use our official libraries to verify webhook event signatures, you can create a custom solution by following this section.

The `Stripe-Signature` header included in each signed event contains a timestamp and one or more signatures that you must verify. The timestamp has a `t=` prefix, and each signature has a *scheme* prefix. Schemes start with `v`, followed by an integer. Currently, the only valid live signature scheme is `v1`. To aid with testing, Stripe sends an additional signature with a fake `v0` scheme, for test events.

```
Stripe-Signature:
t=1492774577,
v1=5257a869e7ecebeda32affa62cdca3fa51cad7e77a0e56ff536d0ce8e108d8bd,
v0=6ffbb59b2300aae63f272406069a9788598b792a944a07aba816edb039989a39
```

> We provide newlines for clarity, but a real `Stripe-Signature` header is on a single line.

Stripe generates signatures using a hash-based message authentication code ([HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code)) with [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2). To prevent [downgrade attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downgrade_attack), ignore all schemes that aren’t `v1`.

You can have multiple signatures with the same scheme-secret pair when you [roll an endpoint’s secret](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#roll-endpoint-secrets), and keep the previous secret active for up to 24 hours. During this time, your endpoint has multiple active secrets and Stripe generates one signature for each secret.

To create a manual solution for verifying signatures, you must complete the following steps:

#### Step 1: Extract the timestamp and signatures from the header 

Split the header using the `,` character as the separator to get a list of elements. Then split each element using the `=` character as the separator to get a prefix and value pair.

The value for the prefix `t` corresponds to the timestamp, and `v1` corresponds to the signature (or signatures). You can discard all other elements.

#### Step 2: Prepare the `signed_payload` string 

The `signed_payload` string is created by concatenating:

- The timestamp (as a string)
- The character `.`
- The actual JSON payload (that is, the request body)

#### Step 3: Determine the expected signature 

Compute an HMAC with the SHA256 hash function. Use the endpoint’s signing secret as the key, and use the `signed_payload` string as the message.

#### Step 4: Compare the signatures 

Compare the signature (or signatures) in the header to the expected signature. For an equality match, compute the difference between the current timestamp and the received timestamp, then decide if the difference is within your tolerance.

To protect against timing attacks, use a constant-time-string comparison to compare the expected signature to each of the received signatures.

### Preventing replay attacks 

A [replay attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack) is when an attacker intercepts a valid payload and its signature, then re-transmits them. To mitigate such attacks, Stripe includes a timestamp in the `Stripe-Signature` header. Because this timestamp is part of the signed payload, it’s also verified by the signature, so an attacker can’t change the timestamp without invalidating the signature. If the signature is valid but the timestamp is too old, you can have your application reject the payload.

Our libraries have a default tolerance of 5 minutes between the timestamp and the current time. You can change this tolerance by providing an additional parameter when verifying signatures. Use Network Time Protocol ([NTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol)) to make sure that your server’s clock is accurate and synchronizes with the time on Stripe’s servers.

> Don’t use a tolerance value of `0`. Using a tolerance value of `0` disables the recency check entirely.

Stripe generates the timestamp and signature each time we send an event to your endpoint. If Stripe retries an event (for example, your endpoint previously replied with a non-`2xx` status code), then we generate a new signature and timestamp for the new delivery attempt.

### Quickly return a 2xx response 

Your [endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#example-endpoint) must quickly return a successful status code (`2xx`) before any complex logic that could cause a timeout. For example, you must return a `200` response before updating a customer’s invoice as paid in your accounting system.
